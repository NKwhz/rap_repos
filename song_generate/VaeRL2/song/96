Sure do you really should I'm still ballin I'm still hoopin
That's why he tryed to sign me to g-unit
Then try to peal my ideas to use it
While I'm two seatin' Porsche coupin' still ballin' like I'm loopin'
So who's this kid, acting like he's used to this?
Swing baby swing, while I continue sing
And you can crown me like a king, like my niggas UG
And all I have to proof is my nice with the usage
if you remove the between you see I achievin you dreams
I'm liver than Thai weed for freaks, drive high speed through streets
Keep spinnin all the time, people say my life is ruined
Like that green, bitch we always got that green light, which you mean?
Before mi affi kill you bee
You're sellin what? You're actin likea fool to me
While I give you the business
See now my cup is full, my vibe is boosted
