But he never took care of you
I like a chick with' a buck tooth yeah it could get fucked too
And shout outs, to the rest of the crew
There's no where to run to
No guns, no drugs, no sex, just truth
Microphone check 1, 2
Microphone check one two
Scuff a cream puff like an old pair of boots
Man you got it all worked out, don't you? Old pair of shoes
You got the munchies, I'm thirsty, you hungry, let's get some food
Coming to get the head of the Chula
thats dropped in the lesson sent to crush fools
Make plans, bring friends, yeah come through
Whoever came and made it there fresh was cool
Heart tell 'em love move
Range a ill repute call 'em swift stick 'em up salute
