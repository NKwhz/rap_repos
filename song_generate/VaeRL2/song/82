I display somethin verbally capable to murder the
These players getting played homie, record label murder
Me is a bwoy weh get gyal term to term
But I'm at the shooting range just 'cause practice makes perferct
Peep my words, yes my heavenly words, word
Go head act up, get smacked in the head with the burner
I though I gave her the world
she love to lick and it made her earl
Checkin' my traps gettin' right wid my paper work
So like I said in the first verse
Do I have to speak any further
Slam yo' back to the curve bruh like sanitation worker
They love to criticize they always say I change for the worse
I made her twerk
Now in the time that you did the paperwork
I wanna ride around in limos, but I'm headin' for a hearse
