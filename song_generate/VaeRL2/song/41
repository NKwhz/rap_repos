evil demons and the jesus of the nazareth
I might close enough to finally buy us a car
Do the Ying-Yang thang or anythang, I'm just a star
Trife with the ratchet like I smite from the Nazareth
Rip my tongue apart
The real is back me Young and Drama
Like what happened to my city? Like what happened to the bars?
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
Lyrical Nostradamus, psychotic mind of Sadaam
But she stared at a nigga, from afar
Cause once you're dead and gone, lfacin' up at stars
Buy the whole shit out, then light up a bar
You die from that llama
And don't worry bout'cha man, he just act hard
And a that a gwaan pon what a gwaan
Better represent what I want to come at cha
