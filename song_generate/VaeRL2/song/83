Ain't none of you nigga's gon' stop this
Every movie yuh do it box office
on some New Kids on the Block shit
I had to get rid of my runner, so I recruited more horses
Paying tuition for college
Hated on by the workers but I'm cool with all the bosses
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
Look at my crew we all got whips
I ain't trying to front, and tell you it's all confidence
To tell ya the truth we not stoppin
You faggots do it for glory
All rise, recognize that you need the Lord, boy
My life a movie not a short film
All he know how to do is false promise
Any other dude who dish rocks want beef
or do it all for me
