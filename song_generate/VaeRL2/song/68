You gotta do somethin' baby
Just as soon as we find grub don't mind the pub I'm straight see
Fuck all those who don't like what I'm saying
Brains are lit, they throw a fit but still they sit
They say be patient so I just keep waiting
And my plug been complainin'
I heard you fuck with them niggas that like to fuck with them snitches
Me and my cousin, D-A-Z
50/50 chance it's what I'm sayin
And you got yourself a virus, stuck in the Matrix
just like these - is it a wonder that I love the 80's
The gangsta mac, a G from the L.B.C
Is it just you or am I fucking crazy?
Video on youtube and she love to replay it
That wax got me turnt up, that shit just the THC
So when I hit these functions, I must remain lit
