You keep it reel wit me I keep it reel wit'chu
You keep it real with me, I keep it real with you
Religious worship is useless; it's like eating meat toothless
In the city of Boom, hit my city with tunes
Won't you get this trapping, having this since mid-school
Yup! I'm a small dude, but I fight like I'm 6'2'
Emphatic? 'cause I'm a addict by habit I'm in His school
But these faggots they keep acting like snitching is cool
And we gettin' nasty like sneezin' in food
All my blood is in my dick, I''m probably dying pretty soon
So try to call me corny  I still spit it true
Shorties standing in the streets with tools
but then you peep her in the club she a freaky lil thing, Uhhhhh
The attitude is funk it while I'm swingin the blues
Now my life is the pursuit, of delighting in His truth
I'm sicker than sticking my freaking dick inside of a bitch's syphilis cooch
