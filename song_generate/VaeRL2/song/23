Y'all pray amin
Cuz broke niggas full of slim and they got dirt on they mind
I'm by myself up on this corner, got to stay high
Believing that we all, were on they side
I got a million dollar spot hennessy and weed
And spread like cancer on they asses
Make me catch her on the late night
Style masters born to make classics
I hangs with niggas who got patterns on they hankey
And international bankers always cash in
Put the charger on they faddins
Yeah, I took the summer off to get it right
I hate to break it to you, numbers always lie
In the winter or the summer, or any time
My mama caused another problem when she had me
When everything is killed or be killed, Fool ever wanna pay the price
