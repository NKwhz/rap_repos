Nicki Minaj - Chorus
Got some partners in hell that'll sneak me in the back door
Take your single ridin' Kia Sport
Err'body in my clique, we ba-a-all
'Lo wears, and Tommy Hil fly shit with a knot
Cause she don't speak no English, my bitch is a foreign
It's about strictly tryin to kill a cop
Knowledge is infinite, I live in a fortress
Fuckin wit me like pickin at a sore
Then catch yo ass slipping at the BET Awards
I usually keep my  fitted hat on
With swift abilities to lift and drop
And I know you're thinkin: 'Wait, Lyte is slim and short?'
Everywhere dem si mi hypocrite a ball
Ambulance on the way, cuz the day I plead is half gone,
Damn, I miss the good ol' days, I wish we had more
