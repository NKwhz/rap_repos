Just incase a nigga out there tryin 'a get me
Call Diamond Supply when I need a lay
fuck bein' nice for too long I kept my niggas at Bay
She hate it when I leave and get the green
Indulging in delicacies, Jet Life is a legacy
It's about money where I live and stay
Why don't you chill for a second and give it a break
I had 7 friends and this kid had 8
When I did and set trip
but there's things I don't and won't do; yeah I read Galatians
Tell me WHY did MANDELA have to live in a cage
Runnin' a race against time is a waste
Had a red eye with that red beam
pure bad beefs is all their likely plan to getting
He was slippin cause the head had him in a daze
And with dialated pupils in my mind in a haze
