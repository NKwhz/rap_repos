And I'll rock it now I need a microphone
Outlined in that white gold
So grimy, nasty, bogus
I check my lyrics close, like with a microscope
Everybody with me good, my bitch bad as shit though
When everybody keep ballin like me and my folks
Don't be spreading lies, my niggas and I know
Tight like a kryptonite with a bike pole
So i ride with a Cali-co
Man, that nigga's married, he can't leave home
So y'all three can give me a Sammy Sosa
Pop'em, pump that shit with my fist as i drop'em
I feel like I'm Al Pacino
Ghost ride the whip while we dancing on the hood
I'm out in Ipanema to relax and reload
Yes, Lil Uzi, like hit that eye roll
