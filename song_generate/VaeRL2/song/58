Uh 1-2-3 that's how it be
Listenin to ?Fraz? braggin about riches
Boy that trap is a accurate description
Now you gon' see a dark cloud and its spreadin' a mile around the city
Let's take a trip around the building
Had sex with a trick, and now she sick
Took for me like a field and the plow with it
I get so high, I ride around in the street
Flip the switch watch me and Twist and how we spit
Young guy still shy around women
Known for bringin bitch ass niggaz out of hidin
Be amiss that's how it is
I took a risk, she took a risk and now we rich
Attacking me right now and it arouses me
to ride around blitted
I got that Bobby Brown but I ran out of Whitney
