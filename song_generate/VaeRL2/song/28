Some people tell me that I need help
Lookin like thirty cent, me and my nigga Dent
Climb in the bed, with a dime in the bed
Me and my beretta, me and my beretta
Now inside the streets Craig Mack's a living Legend
C connection demandin respect
I hope you feel my pain and my repent
A weh! A weh! A happen to D-D-Dem!!!
I did a stretch in a triflin' cell
And I can weed out fakes, that's my sixth sense
Stop your guessin, class is in session
But still I'm surviving, Jah Cure Stay alive in yeah..
standing at the end of your bed demanding to be fed
Hope they don't holler rape and have me in co-nnects
You gotta hustle harder, they can't see me yet
Same class with street legends
