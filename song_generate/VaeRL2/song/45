The Rain Is Fallin' And The Weather Is Cold
He's gone away on business and left her in control
I'm never nervous, I'm a veteran with flows
On this earth but in a place where they can never be stole
Could go on and on and the fool has never been thrown
I got that nigga for about 4 zones, had to get dirty though
T-shirt, head band, tech-marino
If my people had got popped and never did fold
Yo, I got that renaissance, turn-of-the-century choke
So to whom it may concern, this letter is to show
These niggaz ain't never seen dough
Oh what these, you ain't never seen those
got e'm lookin at these hoes like they never seen chrome
So one more time let the energy go
Don't turn ya back on ya friends was in the letters he wrote
Y'all niggas better be ghost
