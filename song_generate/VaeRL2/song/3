Many lip profess I'm verb centered
I spit then I hit then I murk-- yezzur
Now Latrice Burnett, when I first met her
but you can't take a real nigga legacy legends live forever
Shi horny, shi want mi turn record
I keep my mind on my money, gotta grind for the cheddar
Why is it hard for my words to get heard
Glock 9 for the pressure
Like a Iceberg sweater
Cause I'm finna, drop knowledge like a five-per-center
That drop knowledge like a Five Percenter
I Feel So Alive Forever
cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as five percenters
Facial expressions say surrender when that iron enter
We open fire together
need before I beat it up I'm a give her head first
