Think again I'm not that quick to plan ahead of time
Rams was 15 and that then was happenin'
Stompin like Timberlands niggaz, a pair of Nikes
Same spot, where the homie took his last breath of la di
For sayin 'what's poppin?', when he asked 'em 'what's crackin?'
Can't help but to smile
Or you could luck up, and get a paradise from a pair of dice
and everybody who was laughing was a friend of mine,
Bang, bang, fuck a bed fuck a dream
Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it
she wanna get drunken and get buck tonight
Mi si some a dem guh bogle some a dem guh tatty
She got live and let the tongue slide
Well fuck you your top five and their slut wives
That's why I stay getting them checks on the side like a pair of nikes
And having that peace and the presence of strife
