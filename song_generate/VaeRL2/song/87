Dreams fulfilled gave us more room to build
We foolish, getting crunk off the music
I get skewy with the K, hundred shot through him
I used to smoke, now it's only 1 or 2, see?
Too bad its only one for you G
Keep on doin what you're doin
I make groups quit troops split footage for news clips
who's catching coodies pussy gotta doodie
had the fiends looking for new things
Inspire your kids to read the book before the movie
It kinda Gravedigs, well it should, Prince Paul produced it
I'm a muscian, lookin for groupies
If you feelin froggy baby, better look before you leap
Used to beat my meat, I guess I got bologna fore-uh-skin
Start crying, the kid's like Dad what's wrong? Oh it's not you kids...
High grade pon di tole me not cruising
