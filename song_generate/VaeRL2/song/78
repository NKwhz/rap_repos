You say I think I'm hard I say you think too hard
And even though I'm gone I ain't movin too far
As your boys made you think you are
I'm too cool, I'm too calm...
I bring drama like revoluci?n Cubana
Ah we and dem used to par
He bopped, swingin' the gun like a pendulum arm
Penthouse, hotel room cards
Y es la verdad te lo aseguro en tu cara
I want it to pop, I want the revolution to start
Yeah one phone call send two cars
In the grocerie store parking lot, like can I help you ma'am?
You ever need me again I'ma be through in on my celluar
Peace to my nephew Marcus
Bizzy always tells the truth, ah
Bizzy always tells the truth ha
