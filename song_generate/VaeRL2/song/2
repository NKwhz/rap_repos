'Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin Beastie Boy wolf whistle
To let you tell it Randy Moss is your people
It's a trip to hear this music banging knocking your steeples
We were so hot we could sizzle
You want me in your needle
Still I make it look simple
Now hop over the candle stick dick lets see if your nibble
Turns pennies into nickles
She lay you back and play with your nipples
Your mouth should make a very interesting urinal
Dramatic, traumatic, skillfull syllables
You want the Villain up in here licking your nipple
One shot from a little junky ass twenty-two will tear a whole in your gristle
I'm tellin you, don't try to equal
We surrounded by pure evil
Come to your crib and meet your peoples
