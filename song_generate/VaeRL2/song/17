Lil Weezy-ana the boot nigga steel toe
Yeah, you got some silverware, but really are you eating though?
Man it ain't all good, push me to far couzin' see all hood
White-collar congregation makes contributions to his ego
They say it's all bad but it's not,you see it's all good
But just in case its on keep the blue steel in chrome
Livin and what you do, the drinkin 40s, shootin celo
I'm your lil' double stack pop me you really roll
See me in my Aston I'm movin real slow
John Gotti, Supreme Team show
I be in my chair, half the time you think I'm blown
And I'm like 'yeah, I'm just passin through,' silly ho
And my Cuban Link is froze
I got airplanes, now I fly to you with this dope
Still banging, Wolf Ganging as if you niggas didn't know
like a nigga movin' kilo
