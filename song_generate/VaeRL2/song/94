Me in a volcano where lava is spit you couldn't burn me if you damned
Still in the trap signing your shirts giving you dap
Saw his wife secondary to his true passion
And I'm sorry if this world ever treated you bad
DVD player, CD changer, spinnin through the kac'
ya'll don't wanna give me burn with these ruthless raps
Just have one of my gangster bitches meet you and
But like my favorite records, keep spinning new thangs
Yeh, nigga it's Husalah
And whatever it takes I'm gonna bring you back
I used to hustle the corner, but I ain't bringin you that
I ain't slipping through the cracks
Put a bullet in my brain, bury me with 2pac
I know muse and maze will bring you plaque
every minute new tags
Cause baby I'll do ya
