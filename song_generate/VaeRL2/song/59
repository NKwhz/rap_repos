Teachin my peoples the age of the Newer Order
There's no days off, Young Scooter gotta work
Ain't no tellin what I do for a dollar
So gutter, got baptized in sewer water
Kill you for an offer
The past present nigga the future, proper
Spit and insult ya cause they have been here longer
Tryna get rich like Richard Porter
My neighborhood ain't shit like Mister Rogers
In my 'Lac with the preacher's daughter
My nigga Earl hollered
I feel I do the right shit for the wrong person
Scared my dreams were not gonna serve
In a man made hell, right here on earth
I'm a put my sister on her
They hear the hollers
