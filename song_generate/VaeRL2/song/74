To me ain't nothin changed but the things my money bring
I'll leave them cryin from the agony, of defeat
Damn shame, game done did a 360
Outside running wild, fuck TV
I put the peace sign up in my tongue between
I had to get it no time to play with it, my money I was committed
I come with the Yankee hung fitted
Wrapping my bitch up in diamonds from Tiffany's
As a cop was bustin at me but missin
Bags of money like the Money Team
Don't give one fuck bitch I done this shit
shootin up some shit, for the fuck of it an I'm lovin it,
Yeah! Why you cuffin' like the fuckin' police?
Get them up we hanging thug swinging
Gettin' money man it's nothing to me
Funny style, funny niggas
