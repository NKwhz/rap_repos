And whem I'm going for mine I'm like a monkey on a vine
Fuck bitin somebody else, and jumpin on a pile
Fuck the radio and public broadcast it
I'm paranoid but still got the gat and the clip
My rollie got a body son, it costs a life
And I got enough zip lock plastic
3:20 in the morning, bustin' off at the sky
My career is on a roll, man I'm something on that bike
We can go, anywhere you like, nothing got a price
Lil nigga couldn't fight but I was quick to cock a nine
I mean, we all human beings but we not alike
I take nothing for granted
my street, my curb make money on a dime
Visions of that world is what keeps the strong alive
Still on probation but I'm clutchin' on that 'matic
I was seeing supermodel but she wasn't that tight
