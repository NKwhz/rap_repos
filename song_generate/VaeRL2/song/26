Heard that holmie
Punk, with suckers I toy, I'm stronger than a droid
Kissin on her belly, trick on her at Onyx
Now I'm in Atlanta, and his trail is hotter than a sausage
Luke Skyywalker, the man, not a myth
Rappers don't have to meet in order to clash for beef
At the stars next to lord while the coppers at the porpit
from the highest elevation on earth can top this
Can make a blind man see and forget his doctor's appointment
But a bomb isn't stronger than a continent
Beating up the box, call me Oscar De La Hoya
I'm hotter than the block be
Drama's a constant, the world's a hostage
I'm here to tax dollars, raps not cheap
Fresh off the streets and hotter than a four piece
In a bra T-shirt, she a born workaholic
