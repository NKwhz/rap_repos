Put the hot water in your mouth
(Now what about the brother we took out?
What you know about have the freezer in your house
I could see you as Miss Universe, with your crown
I'm new in your town
One piece of paper, then it grew into a book
Making love in the hood, you do it good now
But it's build, check what you speaking, watch how you're using your nouns
Breakin it down and makin your rounds
He had me trapped, I couldn't bounce
I'm comin out switchin and changin your route
Lyrical format I put down
And the shooter gets to hide behind Standing Your Ground
Well get it where you want it, baby I like your sound
Cracked the bottle on some boojie shit I couldn't pronounce
They make a gimmick I wouldn't doubt
