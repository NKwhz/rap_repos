mami all on me cause i'm touchin' her belly
He was coughing up all kinds of information
Rhyme, slide, and glide, but fit perfectly
Hitting like Bonds cause I have a nice slugging percentage
A lost king though I was finna reign
The first time I heard Digital Underground I was in the first grade
I left the tramp screamin, shot her twice up in her face
We fight in prison cages for the rights of liberation
You gotta realized this guy was resurrected
This is Lyte, and I'm just here to say
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of sister Betty
Strapped up, full of clips, back up, hear them spits
And 'The R.E.D. Album' gunna be worth the wait
My life's a rollercoaster, a fucking hurricane
I was wantin fame up in the muthafuckin worst way
This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings
