See I'm the Devil on his shoulder
A black-plastic-bag-body-folder
I'm pickin suckers like a four-leaf clover
See me, I'm a pot smoker, I cannot be sober
Best description reads like a wanted poster
I met a young freak, she came and got in the Rover
Coke and uh, I keep a honest smoker
I can name fifty niggas now that wanted to bone her
Even after the Ozone Awards is over
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him - no sir
You never turned your back on this soldier
No strings attached cause these loafers
I got that ass, the hostage holder
I suffer tortures, all them wars and stompin' soldiers
Love to eat Jellitan to keep my body toner
Mister spectacular, mi body ocular
