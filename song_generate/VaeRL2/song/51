Ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence
curse ya breath, there's no person left
Got your BM in the trap she say y'all losers over there
I'm a draw down on you and your partner so perfect
and stay fly from her toes to her hair
I once heard don't forget
Reckless youngsters, no direction
And everyday alive is just another closer to death
In this life you need to know there's no perfection
To free us from our lower selves
Don't point a finger over herre
It's Murder! Irv don't hurt 'em
OK, I can feel me gettin closer to them
Hammered it across his cranium, he fell over dead
She cryin, headshots put her to rest
like fresh over fresh
