Muh'fuckas better be peaceful fo' sheezle
It's in black people, white people, young people, old people
thanks to my nizzle little jizzle off them hizzle fo shizzle
I'm emotionless, I beat you to a Pulp for yo Fictional
Come swallow the pickle
Can it be that it was all so simple,
accelerate on yo vehicle,
Wanna kiss you, never diss you, cause what we got so official
You can't be dodging no Feds, for no dimes or no nickles
So scream at me, holla, smoke signals
There's no issue, the flow could melt a snow crystal
Feel lucky, so take a chance, I don't hath no evil
They gon show all them old pictures, codefendants and old pistols
You keep this up and I'm a blow the whistle
When niggas sold quarters and dimes and smoked nickels
Eat that bone to the bristle
