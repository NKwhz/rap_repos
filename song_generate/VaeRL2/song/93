Everybody got one
Where at the age of fourteen I was ready to knockin' off punks
When the music started pumpin, everybody got up
I keep my shades on in the hot sun
Like hot Krispy Kremes everybody wants some
Everybody wanna fuck
Mashin' down third straight chokin' on, blunts
Cos Yella  Yella is on the beatbox, huh!
fuck it I'm done, got my competition on the run
Hippopotamus, pot I got is awesome
You're private thoughts, I'm not just
But instead of saying fuck it, tried to snort it off the rug
So I can blast a nigga and his boys - for what?
Sometimes I wanted to call the bluff
Yea I probly won't but
But the Parking Lot looking like toys all rust
