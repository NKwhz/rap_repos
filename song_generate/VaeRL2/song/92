But i can get with her
Need to use it when you're in danger, stand alone just like a ranger
I higgity-hump and rump cos I'm rough like sandpaper
I cuss like a sailor
A hitter, no a barber but carry a extra clipper
Sharp as a razor, cuts like a laser
Peso copped my fuckin phone, I had to hang up - That nigga a stranger,
Throwin up just like a gwaper
Bend 'em up just like a stapler
Whole clique's appetites had tapeworms
If I don't make it doin rap I'm a be ya neighbor
The city hall is scandalous to the average tax payer
I was like yea right like thats getting heard
Oh, bitch I bite like a gator
If you see him, dial 5 dash slayer
Spittin Basquiat, I'm a painter
