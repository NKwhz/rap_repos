All around dick sucks whenever
I'm not a misfit and yo my cuts get better
If love is blind then I was Hellen Keller
When I write and I type that's my type of endeavor
A sick dog from the sixth day of September
Bag a lie, in the basement of the Best Western
Real ass niggas lets break some bread together
That was a random bar but it was hella clever
I'm a young trendsetter
Di time 3am di tenth of september
Try to get Stet, we'll just get Stetter
But you can't cut the neck of the second letter
Changing the weather, by the chop of the Cessna Propellers
Built up inside no one bares to measure
Actin' so damn bitter, lettin' go of their temper
Use my neck as a scratch poster, rip out every last one of them red curls
