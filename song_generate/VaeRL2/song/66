Ask dem hoes uh huh yea ask dem hoes
Too $hort fucked it up came back again ho,
'Man, how he get in? I thought they had a dress code?'
Make a nigga wanna get withcha and spend dough
And now they try to diss cause they can't get gold
After one toke they want some more... they can't let go!
Hundred mad till the very last breath yo
I'm just a little old hope with his back against the ropes
My flows leave these rap cats ketro
Catch me dippin in the banana ten fo'
I-20s in this bitch, and that shit is a wrap, Lets Go
Stomp like Timbalands and step shows
This nigga had mad deco
Hoes creepin four deep in a black Benzo
Bro, you're too slow, hit the danceflo'
I'm a 110 street cat and had my back against the hope
