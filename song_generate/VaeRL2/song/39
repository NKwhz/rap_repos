And when dealin with the Lench Mob you gots to know
I put a tag on your toe and call you John Doe
To join the brilliance of wilderness and soar through the Congo
Go lay up with a model and watch the news tomorrow
I don't want you to follow
But I'm grown and it's tough for you to swallow
'Hmm, you had drinks, even 1 or 2 Corona's?'
Brown, VA and of course you got Oakland
I call you on the phone
Cos when I call u on the fone
you should pose mothafucka cuz I got you on scope
You be a memory mimickin me, cause you got bold
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
Where I go, New York goes, keepin New York flows
Not only did you almost
Seven digits nigga, two commas hoe
