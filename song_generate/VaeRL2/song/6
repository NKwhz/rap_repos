I'm right here on the block
I'm in a big-body slab, wit' the rear chopped off
4th Reich, my soldiers on the blocks
We runnin' through your town, in prescowns, dripped over sawed offs
I'm God while ya'll are wrestlin' over pork chops
It's over for y'all
Watch your ears, we're gonna drop the bomb
And she got all the signature features her momma got
He quench earth's thirst for all
Turn upside down, let her twerk on the wall
Wu-Tang blower on the board
I was trained to be a soldier for god
I can't stop, man, the whole world want more
And get shot over knots to clock
Break a muthafucka off, soldier, raw dog
Yesterday's news tomorrow's forgotten thought
