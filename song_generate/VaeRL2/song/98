So you and your boys are ass-out
Died like Ricky on his mama couch
Hold your nose, dead bodies are around
For that china white I lay a nigga mama down
In the bank and I?m only cashing large amounts
Little church dude trippin, sayin my mama shout
I stash the huuneds of bands at my mama house
Thick rolls by the large amount
Bring her home to my mama now
Get my guap back, you'll
You hear it pumping in pubs you buy the bar a round
And Rob Rebeck on the mix, with the barbarous sound
C'mon playboys, bring the cars back out
And what we ought to know, they keep me in the dark about
while he spark that pound,
Hustlin' like a slave tryin to shut your baby mama mouth
