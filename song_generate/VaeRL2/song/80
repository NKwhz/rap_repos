Tomorrow don't you worry 'bout
Don't get caught up in the now
Isn't it true that Hip-Hop was bigger when we all loved it out?
in back of the ambulance?
Is Right back up in the house
My girl works a job that pays 5 a fuckin hour
We're like lumberjacks holding the axes that brung it down
Today I bought a fit that was in the thousands
All I had was wee pows
Word got around about the niggaz from the Piddound
Trap rules, nigga scrap, jugging pounds
You a bitch nigga, pussy nigga, you need a fucking blouse
to see ya stumbling to the ground
Perkin' up in the back of the outless
Creepin' Up In Ya Fuckin' House
I come to buck you down because I'm a fuckin' clown
