Imma grab your waist then Imma grab your face and
That look like four racetracks, now chase that
I just fucked up a check, I'm about to get it back
(I gets amped when I think about the slave camps
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Fuckin' around with me everything's about to fail ya
I'm in here chillin' in my room thinking about where I'm at
Just because you got a big gat you'se the same man
Just to chit-chat and talk about wedding plans
And I'm just about ready to snap
Own that other crib, they just a house guest, Sinbad
She get hella-loud when we bang
Now I know, remember the ho I spoke about named Fran?
They hear about speed and a acurate scratch
Complete with a staff to tabulate the math
Snatch you out your car so fast, you'll get whiplash
