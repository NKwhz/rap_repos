And I beat the pussy like a new song
but I was brought back to reality by a toot of a horn
I'll transform like Laserbeak and sleep inside a boombox
My strip like a pool hall
I'm tryna keep it romantic, I'm like Matthew McConaugh
a stranger in the town, not many raws, I make it right and move on
If the girl pretty squeeze her titties like a tube top
My name Milli, chicks feel me like brand new soar
Got girls in all sizes, I'm something like a shoe store
But I still save money like a coupon
Then tomorrow night, find a new jawn
Baton Rouge, Laphey, KC, Miami and New York
I'm flexing in cars, you flex and you floss
Fast life make no sence when you dead and you gone
And when revolution comes, your ass gets scared, and you pause
This not hip hop, when that 2 pop
