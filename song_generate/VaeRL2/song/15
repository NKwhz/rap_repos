Listen to the tracks that rolls
To my nose your scent is just as sweet as a rose
I can't contain, what I can't control
She real fine reminded me of my last ho
Droppin it with ?, but my actions tango
Ass screamin just like a damn hoe
Around the globe, they treat us like Al Capone
NIggas say I'm fly wit the rappin but I can sang though
But this girl followed me just like a shadow
Wack flows - I rain on 'em sort of like a Pharoah
We speak in terms of Mac Dre and Fat Tone
I heard you take the  skulls and eat 'em up like a cantaloupe?
I wanna teach you what I can't show
Always sipping bottles of rum like Jack Sparrow
with or without a pistol they know I stand alone
In it see me riding, getting blown like a saxphone
