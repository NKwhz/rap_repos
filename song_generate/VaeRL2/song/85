I know I'm playa so you haters you're just wastin ya time
Growing up a fine young man like a stallion
Like my man Wyclef-'I wear my sunglasses at night'
He died a tread, It was passed the asking
They say with ever thing comes a price and a risk
Sick of blastin' and dashin'
Hoes in the club man, shakin and shakin
Nigga seh nyam when yuh classy a dine
Inclined to resurrect the deaf, dumb and blind 'That's right'
Before you felt like your heart was stabbed by a knife
But you just can't leave that life
what happened to my class queen?
Now my mind is fucked up and I can't think
I ain't a hustla makin dollars from a dime and a nick
A man's world, but a white man's planet
And don't say a word, just act like a mind
