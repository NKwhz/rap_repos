So now it's time for me to blow this joint
And I can bring the pain and bring the joy, so pick the toy
Titties floppin, niggas watchin, hoes nina poppin
If I run out, then more than likely its on me, so I'm gone b',
Twenty degrees on the wrist, no defrostin
And my phone keep plunckin', cause these hoez keep jockin
Listen to the voice go drip-drop nigga
Teeth on bling, rolly on flick
Flop lookin' boy, Stop lookin' boy
Attended all the right parties cause he voted on bills
Poppin' mollys and Bugattis, coppin' Mozzys no deposit
And she likes to flaunt it cause she knows she got it
Pussies who got nuts 'cause I'm goin' all in
He didn't wanna do it, somebody prolly forced him
The golden voice, holdin toys
The most notorious, poet laureate
