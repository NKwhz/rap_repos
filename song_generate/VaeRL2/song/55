Wakin' up like OMG O-OMG like a alarmin'
Kill pon road lef him fi paparazi
and me young quez strapped, and Ali
Come on, bitch, let's have a party
Four, five and sixes head crack garages
Some bwoy ya, redda dan a carpet
How could I deny Jah Rastafari
These fucks, schemin so they can charge me
Hungry CEO success is salami
You putting me open to Stephanie and Giovanni
Sacrifice the hardship for those wearing a target
Y'all only hope is wooden stakes and garlic
I break ground like earthquakes and part the seas
Like we in jail sellin cigarettes, bring a carton, nigga!
I was raised in Cali just like a palm tree
You wearin coke whites, but my Vans are clean
