The Quicker Blood technique
Hey what can I say, alligator suflay
I bust about a dozen cuts in my LP there's none the same
Depicting they're frustrations
Especially if my behavior was straight
Circulate it like a plague, a daily paper front page
Yeah he bust his very first nut today
Get trapped in the one way, ready for the gun play,
a friend of me, regularly play the greater tongue tenancies
She ain't concerned when she turn up the bass
The majors, ungracious
I caught Hell in the worst of ways
I'm wearin' jordans , very first ones made
Now you're the player of the day
Yo yo yo I seen good days sun rays church sundays
If I was Tony the Tiger I would say the world was 'great'
