You tried to step on toes now you're dissed - case closed
Blocked your bluff, now your respect is stolen
Oh, your shit, ain't gold!
I'm lost, and I don't know which way to go
Even if it means goin toe to toe with the Benzino
I got the mary rolled, so it's set in stone
the god is back, make bitches say hoe
Between two partys thats escalated in enciroments
Mi face with di cake soap
Atlanta, I get busy in the Braves home
Yea I'ma hammer like a fiend, when he need it, let it smoke
Roll my penitentiary Tennessee nigga in jail clothes
I'm in a 911, this shit is rented though
They prance around the home like princesses obsessed with kissing every toad
They take dick in they ear, they take dick in they nose
