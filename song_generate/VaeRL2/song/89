Ya battle ya sayin' Goodbye like Tevin Campbell
She FaceTime me so I can see where she at
Ya mash on the gas roll right by they ass
Most of the time I hate rap
Broke bitches wanna know why I say that
Bow and arrow arch aimed at your Randy Savage wave cap
Thats Right, the life of a cave man
My mama named Durkie and my daddy named Yan
Gave them a taste, tell them take a taxi, I pay the tax
Cuz I gots to get paid, gets mine in the 9, thats why I stay strapped
for all that time I spent in the back
His flight leave at 8 and at 9 my plane land
Speed like Racer treat you like a wack rhyme and erase ya
Hit the world full blast, my crime pays cash
I got a wink from a fine ass sista dressed in black
Do it like I am, big name collabs
