No that's illegal!
I'm a fire shots off like I know Brian Nichols
Off that thizzle, Bitch I'm ballin, blow my whistle
We could hit the Staples Center bro I don't like people
Dead-end your ego like vehicle
That a brother could be so damn pitiful?
You shouldn't be, so damn material
They wonder how you ended on your ass, it's simple
Especially when I know yo' man is fee-ble
wacky niggaz fo my peoples,
I got a stash to hold my pistol
I read Girl Scouts, Trans Metro and Invisibles
domes get blown like whistles
Nigga don't worry God don't like evil
New Boyz are nothin girl? Your man's still wrinkled
I check for the crew, then break out like the measels
