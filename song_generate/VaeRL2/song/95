Being watched all day like enemy's prey
Ready for war, anytime, anyplace
Nigga keep on letting that bitch playa hate
PeeWee Longway, I made the name
The forty's kickin in I gotta drain my main vein
My life ain't the same, I want change, I maintain
But that's not the game play, nor the way that we make waves
Terror Squad legacy live the next millennium
I forgot to take my medication
I use the meditation, I stay patient
Pray to God, every day, that it stay the same
I'm on every case like Perry Mason
gray patients I stay ancient
inmates in every state, live heavyweights
Before they see the cemetary and the remains to bury
But soon as I got my change, they say I changed maine
