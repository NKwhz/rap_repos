Unconditionally my aspects to cash checks
I'm a walkin' testimony still I stand yet again
Don't you love the way we clamin Bankhead, stankhead
They might as well have said
Violate Slouch an Steven a you mi a send a hell!
But that's fine, got my whole hood behind me so it looks like a rep a set
make a right and then a left
My attitude is parallel to carousels
Yo meck Fanny, Suzie and Gren a fret
auch wenn sie hoffen sie h?tten lange getroffen
And when the lines are designed, you'll be rating them a ten
More hemorrhaging, high school, first relationship, death's a friend
I???m making them plays in Delaware
They know not from whence they came, so they rebel against
Get the Audi cause it's classy, get yo lady friend a Benz
Check the metaphors, make sure they're making sense and then
