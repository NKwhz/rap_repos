My Murder One Team Something's best untold
see a million bucks, most of us will end up broke
That was the end of the convo
Used the mic to reach out and touch, instead of the phone
Their thumbs in their butt-hole
Trying to get some dough
If you're losing your grip, hold tight to the end of the rope
I'm sucking the areolas my nigga the best of both
are you blind I drive a lambo try to proceed end of the road
Cause while you sittin' on the phone tryin' to get some shows
Tryin to get some bones
My nigga welcome home
And if it's good she'll bring ya customers in measuring pots, but yo
But I got to give mama my number before the club close
I asked the counter person for the biggest box of Trojans
When it's gonna be they family on the front row
