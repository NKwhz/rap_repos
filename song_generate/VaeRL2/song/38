Got that Dasher Dancer Prancer Vixen Comet Cupid Donner Blitzen
It's enormous shit, new informer shit
It's +Nuttin But a G Thang+ G-Unit & +Dr. Dre+
Wicked like a witch doin sorcery
You labelled Paw nervous just know I do this job dirty
I give you this dick, you hit the lottery
Less bombings and a sharp decline in whose in poverty
But if you gonna do it then fucking do it properly
sometimes you attract them ducks but everything is done on the hush. nightime is the right time and sometimes you get nervous at flight time but wonder what she get when it goes perfect the same night and you still want to work it
And ma I'm gon' show you like that, you be hollerin
Diamonds dancing, my new wrist, stay in the kitchen, I water whip
I'm butt naked with my chopper, nigga
Got 'em screamin like horror flicks
We all chipped in nigga and we all hurting
They found me jacuzzin with my sorcerists
I'm chasin dreams like Dr. King
