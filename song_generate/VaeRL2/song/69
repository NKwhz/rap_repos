Standin' around for where the translucent lucid spit
The one I'd prolly grow old and have a few cute kids with
I'm just staring at you through this tint
Doin it, If I'm havin a good time and you ruin it
Every blue moon, might see a few shooting strips
But when the tear drops, and the few you bleedin'
Call ?? and how Doc abuse loose-leaf
Red-boned or even fucked-up black Zulu bitches
You're young you're dumb and you used to be innocent
Hundred missed calls after that new toolie rings
Hot Nik shoot you with the gift
If you don't think I worked ever second for it you stupid bitch
Roll through cause it's cool to boost the spirit
He say 'son stop, it's dudes you feedin'
you niggaz can't get wit me can't daddy I move too quickly,
So I can produce while I move through the city
