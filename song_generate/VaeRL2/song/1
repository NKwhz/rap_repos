Took a swig of my man's goose
I mold like clay, and roll dice just like Andrew
Low and behold, granny was right at the do'
I like looking in to your eyes just like a muse
I love my dad too
She ain't the groupie type but I had to
I'm a certified Hustla High graduate
I arrived at private school thinking life was nice and cool
It don't even matter I was acting a fool
Swing empty cannons at ease just like Dan Boone
That ego be chirpin just like a Boost
All the bitches say that I'm cute, blowin on it just like a flute
And I bet you think if you snap your little fingers I will run right back to you
So make room cause I'm sweepin up like a broom
I be going up like a balloon
And dismantle, handle, everyone I ran through
