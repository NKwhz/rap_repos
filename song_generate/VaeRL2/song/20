Let's get it started RIGHT ON TIME ha!
Sean's a soldier, see the stripe on my arm
hit licks like on a guitar
You're a GMO seed of breed in my organic garden
Tank Dog til they bury me, I cross my heart
Smells the funk or the pound that's in the car
But what the hell everybody yells for me to drop down my guard
Get a swisha, a lot of liquor, now buy the bar
Blade black, in a leather couch, marijuana
Girls that look like Lana
Nigga they be talkin bout my cars
If you talkin bout Louie V Mob, nigga talkin bout my partnas
You don't got it down like moi
you know we go with the swagga, leave they mouth wide - Maan
Played out like stadas
Messagin' the fo' fo' low, Illa the king the khan
