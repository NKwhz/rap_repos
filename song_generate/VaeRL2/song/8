Put me in the same room with her pimpin and I bet some strippin' occur
What it be, dawg? We gettin money here
Waitin' for the right day to get what we deserve
now you hurting for going head up with the steel curtain
Some new,something fresh, something differant
Smack 'em up with the heater
On edge sippin' from a keg of vinegar
Stabbin up the jam yeah son shit's clear
Put listening stations in the store and let the public hear
Hoes be double teamin' send em' to the fuckin' cleaners
Wen di berretta beat inna dem fucking ears
she waan di rockula well until it curve
Because art without an audience pretty much defeats the purpose
Cause the beat is real funky, dear
It's the return of the assassin, I believe in the creed of the greedier
I paint imagery kid stunning pictures
