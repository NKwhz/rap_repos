Hit the button and light shit up like Red Dawn
Dem a victim of mi extortion
Avon whipped up the hard he was right next door
Hmm me? hmm ho I think not ah, got skeet from 9 next to the glock
Hmm me? hmm ho I think not ah, got skeet from 9 next to the block
Ain't never copped a plea to get off
My little girl got a heat exhaustion
the love over  to rock like 'em ornaments
First round draft pick dawg I'm more like Lebron
If anybody calls, I went to the store!
I'm not a human cause I'm more like Megatron
Then she wanna hold my wand like Emma Watson
Pero ya que te conosco what I got I guess not
Hordes watch on as we walk by shellshocked
Two women butterly lovely in front of me got my head gone
Is a hoodrat slut before I get raw
