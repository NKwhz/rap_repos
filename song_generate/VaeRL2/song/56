Plus he had to be at home a long time ago
So I went to office depo and bought that bitch a globe
Case closed, Add more to my bank roll
Smoke both hands on a piano
And fuck rap, you're my backbone
Living in the castle dark mask got my back so
Trying grab all my cash flow
Cause you handle that ball like a pro
filled with robots dancin like Michael Jacksons or Janet Jacksons-- Control
I'm a Holmes, got a big ass home
So I chose to rap yo, causin' a fiasco
Sitting in my scraper, watching Oakland Gone Wild... Ta-dow
Saying it's not good for man to be alone
Not in a condo, so to the block I had to go
Cause I was wide eyed and open nosed on my approach
You want the god of war? Man I'ma connoisseur
