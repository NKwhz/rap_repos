Blowing my high rolling by when Gunn die
Yep I got about three friends who owe me at least 10 bucks a piece
Why? Everytime I wake the dead up, they try to eat my head up, Why?
No swine diets, the strength of Goliath
You fill me with no fright and will get bust tonight
Passionate I can be extra sometimes
stacks piled high, let the hundreds fly
Diamonds bright when the sun shine
Make heads spread with mics like the legs of dykes
This girl walked by, she caught my eye, I said, 'What's happenin?'
Fuck the rap scene, I like the smell of gasoline
You gone have to tangle wit a Hypnotize, get suprised
Excitin' and amazin' havin' a real friend of mine
Your body is bangin' like them Bloods and Crips
But satan's ridin my back in the dead of the night
Candy sky, welcome Adidas
