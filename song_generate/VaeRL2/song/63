Your money right but your credit aint then the bank still wont loan it
On a beach, gonna reach lot of peaks, I skeet then I wanna go sleep
I gets fly for no reason
That my mom used to cry when I brought home the dees
You better take a deep breath and keep followin
the northside, eastside, westside following
Should I get St. Ides or Olde E?
Thank God it ain't a cocame, thats when my momma spoke to me
My glock cocked, niggaz drop when my shots flowing
fahr ich von Frankfurt nach Hamburg und Treffe die Mongo Clikke
I am your neighborhood drug dealer, ain't talking soap when I say I got Dove nigga
Whether domestic violence or coke deals
Or pay child support for your kitten
Ridin with a couple of bricks, and the police on yo hips?
Son, I'm nice, you're phoney
As long as I'm alive I'ma keep on rollin
