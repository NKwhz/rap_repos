I skate with the bomb
Dope Boy Magic made this song
Understandin' the Boss is like payin' the cost
Ha ha ha ha, I'll never go alive, 45 Blazing shots
It's sports, Titanium quartz, Iranian taught,
Nigga know how we getting it cause we getting it on
But I'm glad he did cause it made me strong
I be rockin them beats Will.i.am not
Slick sauce on my clique boss, this ain't Kriss Kross
I might slice you up with this pimpin', cause I'm Zelda with this sword
If anybody come lookin for him, tell him he gone
It's politics - ain't it all?
Hey I got money, how I got it? ain't important
Before the crack, before the AIDS, before the
I can run it back, nigga cause I'm straight with the Roc
Waiting for the day god repays me for
