For this bad car that go along with the breath
I'm blowin' trees, tokin' with a smokin' flare
Get it all together dot the 'I's and cross the Ts
To the femine queens that the God selects
They think paisano's wylin, that boy reckless
With every day you let me live it's a story to tell
I remember MC Lyte dissed Antoinette
Pistol whip your kids, I'm a demon, I'm a rot in Hell
'specially a bitch nigga that walk wit the feds
cause the depressed faggot is cancerous as walking dead
Nervous and awkward at the smallest events
Balled thru the summer, caught a case for the half-of G's
Doesn't matter if you gain the world and all its wealth
So I give work a shot instead
I'm in first and y'all in second
Because them hot ones from the choppas tear ya body to shreds
