I want I want to believe
Know what she want and she gon' get it, know what I want and I'm gon' hit it
Peep my rhyme, cause that, shit's off-timin
If I say yes she want me to beat her like I got ani-mosity
Let's get some real niggaz banging, stop ganging on the weenies
Go numb until I can't feel, or might pop this pill
I got a thing for women
Why can't I be that dude I saw rapping on the TV
Any signs of One Time or resistance
Get a job, I used to sell rocks in front of my mom's building
If your bride is one of my bottom bitches
I'm made to creep, from above and beyond, beneath
Blowin up just like Oprah Winfrey
Cause she bought a jum of soap, from one of my boys, it's
Mad with no music, but happy cause I'm free
I don't slip, but I stalk with the whip
