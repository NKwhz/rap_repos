Call me to repentance if I ever go astray
I done made the kind of music where I never go away
Cause I'm a slow pace, never race, never smoke the crack base
You never gonna have braids, you'll never know black pain
Never wanted the come I would never throw ya name
Better known as Caine
Printed on my shirt, yes, there's bold and plain
I'm a soloist and knowin this you better grow an extra fist
I ain't even runnin' game, told her roll a plane
I prefer RC over Coke and Pepsi
Coupes and champagne for the whole campaign
No time for a hater go that way
Iller the most of the pack yea
We can go blow for blow until we're old and gray
Or could it be the realisation all girls owned a Jenny?
Thirty thousand on a crap game, wander to stop your campaigns
