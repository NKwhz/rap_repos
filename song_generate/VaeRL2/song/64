Baby Im So High
Shawty is so ratchet, baby I'm so ratchet
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it in with no blanket
But I ain't committin' no crime
I'm a beast I ain't speakin' no lie
They comin' at'cha, this I bet'cha, hypnotizin' yo mind
If I say it, then I mean it, I ain't spittin' no lies
But tonight the moon is red and shit ain't feelin' so right
Ya'll know damn well he ain't flippin' no pies
But if I run out I ain't tripping I'll choke a bitch
We blow mics and I'm breakin in with soap dice
Keyz, Keyz jinglin no license
Kids crying, still snipin', no lackin'
But I still will heal with no bandage
We be spitting the John Blaze, please give me besos mami
In battle mode weak lyricists I'm toe tagging
