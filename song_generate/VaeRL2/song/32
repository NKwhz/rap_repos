I'm a rock star in real life I'm an astronaut outta sight.
C'mon, girl, now, show me a shot now ... aaight!
And I can't even give her a phone call outta spite
we ain't stop to count da cash, nigga
the suprise, sunrise, bout ta die
Guinea tragedy, South Park strategy
Knock the bastard, smiggity-smack it out the park, right
Bitch I slap your mama bitch
gettin high as a kite, takin a bite, outta crime,
Outta sight, outta mind, never does it mean outta might, outta rhyme
when there's so many chippers saying I'm running outta time
I know you felt neglected, you called me 'outta line'
Ya niggaz got to be out cha mind
In '92 I let the Cage outta Alex
haters start yappin, niggas bound to start cappin,
The feds place every night will have your heart racin
