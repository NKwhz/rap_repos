Pick your jaw up off the floor and tuck your tongue right back in
And let me get into some fly gangsta shit
digging down deep hey, look what I find
And my little boy looks just like daddy
Rats, snakes, yea mayne the game is full of wildlife
Toast of my achievement
defining moments of my life
I'd crash after sticking it to the window of my cabin
Ya'll niggas better sober up before ya'll speak to me, don't come at me high
Sexin' freaks on the hood of my caddy
he opened up his jacket, I opened up my packet
Wake up in the morning wipe the cold from my eyes
When you see me comin, I don't front I fight
Nobody know crime, throw up that sicc sign
I'm nasty, so come right at me
I'm a made motherfucker, I don't tuck my ice
