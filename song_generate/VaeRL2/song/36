Searchin for a love throughout the ghetto
or when you ballin an they out there broke
Salute 2 all the bitches that stayed down n rolled
We stay settin' pace in the race now let's go
By di way how dem spoken
Two of Amerikkaz most, straight out the West Coast
All about the green aint worried bout yellow
And stop worryin' 'bout the next hoe
Straight rain now making me fowl let's bow
You ain't Did It? Hour gettin Dope
attack ta blow I'm aimin at your neck & throat
Bout them racks pussy nigga I'm aiming at your head bro
Fuckin bitches that won't let you make it out the friend zone
nuh trust dem from mi see how dem roll
And it ain't a question that I be out to get the dough
You wanna talk, wanna scream out help though
