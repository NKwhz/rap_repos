Now say my name c'mon
Five foot eight, standin ten feet tall
yo cash, blast that ass won't last fo one mo day like Nate Dog
And I mix it with the Goose it go straight to my brain, gosh
When I woke up they had me chained to the floor
when I need someone to kind of lay my praries on
Bwoy run away like race horse
A pimp by night, but tamales my day job
Bakes and makes sports, can play like eight chords
Often gettin' trailed by cops, better get away by bendin blocks
I'm hard to top shoot at plenty I bet it gonna knock,
Ever since you met the trick I made more
No justice, I perish the thought
SPV is backin' me, bustin' wide playa lock
I breez through artists, It's funny and shit, they wanna
I can stay long, what did I say wrong?
