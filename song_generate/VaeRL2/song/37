god before anything
Women follow the 24, so I'm choppin' on 26
If it wasn't for those spankins, I'd probably pop pain pills
My dinero like Shapiro I see Johnny Cochran wages
Or is it, all the think to thought makes me
The boy hide his grits, the boy pot ain't grits
Had to shake a couple niggas, everybody won't make it
You our main inspiration when we rockin' on stages
Won't find me in no club unless I'm gon' be compensated
And it's a gamble when you step outside so everybody got they heat
They want me off the premises
Everybody on Ten-I-see
Go and get 'em or we gon' chase him
Hear this song I'm not complaining
What a freak wanna trip off, sip off the lame with the
Bumpin R&B - and I got the leaf - on the 23's
