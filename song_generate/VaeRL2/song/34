She rots Disney
They don't wanna give me chances all they want is the beef
Smilin up in yo face but behind yo back they talkin shit
Spending whole damn day watching me
real nigga on the scene, know a playa comin mean
The only rapper you know that get it hot in this,
Don't matter you got to go out and get it or quit it
Maybe we can ride to a place more discreet
Night and day to shots whistlin'
Six backin out the drive away, dropping the wig
Put the pipe to his mouth like a dentist, on lil steve
Is harder to achieve than many wanna believe
So you know I pick six like a deion TD
With my nocturnal rhymes and editorial clips
And I'ma let the audience listen
We can all get out of debt, and we can pay off these bills
