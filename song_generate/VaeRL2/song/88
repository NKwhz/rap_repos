Where no one could bother me
Get on the ground, give up your property
The air's thick round Oxford Street
Las Vegas spending thousand dollar chips
Now I came up, a fifteen thousand dollar lick
Cause how I'm supposed to shine without the proper bling
Yo I be all up in the dorm like I'm down to scholarships
As a youth I prayed I make it out of poverty
Only way we could chill, if it's 'bout the dollar bill
Feds tried to rocket me and knock me out properly
3 goon chains a hundred 40 thousand dollars each
I'm talkin' bout, quarter-ki's
What can I do but bow down and give offerings
300 thousand, count that even 4 30
Well let me say this, I'ma live forever regardless how my doctor feels
Straight up how my posture is
