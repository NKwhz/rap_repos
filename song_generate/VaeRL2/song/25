I'm a bad motherfucker
we kill each other just lost another brother
But I ain't trippin on that other color
Coward ass motherfuckers
Who I've never met before born to another mother
Why? To smoke another brotherman?
Why would one keep another under?
Cause 15 years later the other died that summer...bummer
Bad to the mother, pass me the rubber, then your lover actin bad under covers
you better find another sucker
I could just leave it and treat it like another supper
My little man got fourteen-years for car-jackin' a undercover
Done discovered love like a mother fucker
Damn, find another lover
Makes a brother wonder
You're in the zone, when you need another upper
