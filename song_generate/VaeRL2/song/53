Because I hear what I'm sayin I know I'm killin this shit
Say the word and I'll ghost ride this bitch instantly
Uptown swingin it, focus while I'm wringin it
That's 666, still no signs of a three-sixty deal
the streets are frigid so I speak it vivid
Cause these niggas hoes, and these bitches greedy
Twinkies shinin, pinky ring
I be ready to bring the quick swing like I'm still 16
Straight p-i-mp-i-ng in a G-6 wit me, See
Satisfied easily by the simplicity
I'm slappin bitches with 9 inches, the limp dick
and if I'm fienin I need to see beamin
Even when I spit it I'mma be the spitting image
Yeah, I be slidin', I be creepin', nigga
Please believe me, my team is cheesy
Livin' in sin, I beginnin' to think
