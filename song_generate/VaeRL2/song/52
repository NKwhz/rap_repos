We got the real ones
It's not a clear day until the war is done
How he took the bills andhe  payed somethin on each one.
Self-destruction is not a key function
That locc to the brain cuz' it's all redrum
Made plenty enemies, but his logic was
We got decent drugs, We got decent drugs
When I'm walkin' up, I'm bossin' up
Ah-ah-ah, we're all hungry, but before we tuck
And I am nothing but, I'm God-blessed nigga, what?
Was housing the nigga just because he thought he must
Bitches brains I bust, feel the lust in God we trust
It's so funny, honey got him sprung
Love until it's hurts because it's not enough
First page on a magazine, mean muggin cause I'm crunk
The holy trinity of hip-hop is us
