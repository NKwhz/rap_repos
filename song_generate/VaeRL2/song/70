Sincerity is neezle sin
I went from flippin them things, cripplin triple beams
Eighty percent of American business is created illegally
Thrown away, zonin' grey, GT, Diesel jeans
I've seen my enemies in critical conditions
They got this bullshit case on me and they thinkin it'll stick
just not get trap taste this lyrical bliss
Bush dropped bombs on babies in Middle East
I seem to be triple teamed
My hands dirty, trying to keep little Lea
Examining the evil deed
the eye ignite here, I release the pistols clip
Infatuated with material things
no Bently flippin less yo name is Felix Mitchell listen
Five hundred SL green, ninety-five nickle gleam
With a lick or real sick with a lyrical brick
