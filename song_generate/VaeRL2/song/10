You're far from the usual
But his wife would answer the phone and to me that was unusual
Special and Unusual
Anti-Gangsta Bitch, sporting new jew-als
The world don't owe me shit and the feeling's mutual
Tootles to you, poodles
+Friend or Foe+, +Politics as Usual+
And show you how to do it right, I could be the manual
And the diamond watch, the whole kitten kaboodle
Real is all I ever speak, every quote is factual
Smoking that pruple
They told me the town is valuable
Stay putting niggas in graves so i just keep me a shouvle
Creativity first-tide, with actual
Caught you on the 9 in all blue yelling I'm a neutral
My bitches booshie, walking with a poodle
