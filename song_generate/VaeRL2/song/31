She call me daddy and never short wit daddy money
niggas better get your girl your girl all inside of me
Niggaz be damn near forty and still tucking
Man we work for Him and we love it
I'm 'None the Richer', I just kiss her on the lips and keep trucking
I was sick before T.I. was the King
I poke 'em with the Obelisk and flee from the scene
yeah they still talkin' like some tricks
They keep talkin' and I'm dumpin'
But I wish for each to have freedom of speech
I kill more kills than the quils from Tequila
Gotta keep a gun on me, cause I be pourin' pints of lean
Climbin' on this night club trick
Persistant, we keep comin' like some nigs
Gone, niggas is moist like Duncan Hienz
The fetish is Louiane, I'm bombin' like Hussein
