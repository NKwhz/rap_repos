Please don't interscope
Break my back to give derelicts daps and dinner rolls
Die for my family and live for the moment
When I catch the bitch, I'ma gangsta lean-her - WHOA
The mass release the gas that simmer the soul
from the cavebitch with the nasty persona
History's a mystery and lies were sold
Matter fact you ain't fuck with me this time last year though
Standing on the block with dice and wireless phones
My style is flashy like a fiver strobes
Tuggin' all on my Avirex clothes
So hot you'll need a fire hose
I had a couple meetings with Def Jam and Interscope
The toast... did I forget the toast? The toast is toast, damnit I burnt the toast
Rocking shows at retirement homes
Tryin to keep a low profile like parole
