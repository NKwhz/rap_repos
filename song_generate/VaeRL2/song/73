Don't touch what you can't grab
You know you wanna scream to the top of your lungs, but you can't
Cuz' I'm permanent and sharp enough to cut through glass
But Vakill, ain't he nice? I spit virus none of you cats fathom
I say what up, she say what up, what up, you a parrot?
Frontin' like a gangsta, but you's a faggot
I hope you hittin ass better than that blunt you pass
To the suckers who ain't knowin, that's just too damned bad
Bridging The Gap from the blues, to jazz, to rap
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
Around the handle, a fuck you ban-danna
Right between the Loch Ness Monster and Chupacabra
Nice and smooth, not a girl that's too fast
I can fly from place to place quicker than you can snap
We ain't never scared to pave a new path
Loose cameras, big hammers, Station Wagon, blue Phantoms
