you catch blows to the motherfuckin nose
Facts and wisdom killed the catacism entrusting' the pope
And that's the end of the Flintstones
So that means there must be hope
and me head touch me toe
I didn't realise then, but even so
I'mma put six in where the money go
Can we shake the trials and tribulations?  Even when the money's slow?
I never get anything less from these hoes
Me and Thug in the alleyway, we hit em up below
Chameleon before the Chamillionaire was even known
Although my hands are bleedin, a side effect of this moda
You comin in with records, is this where the money goes?'
I fucked his friend but it's all good
Leave the iPhones home skill sets must be shown
Yeh well, fucking oath!
