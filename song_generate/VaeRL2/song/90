What? For my Height niggas Uncut
I wasn't satisfied with just one
My spit funky like James brown body is inside my pickup truck
If money change niggas, why I still 100?
I get rythym like a hippie drum son
Jealous rappers runnin up but they need to toughen up
And I ain't fucking with a freak unless it's 3 of us
Still getting crunk staying drunk huh
If they ask you where I'm at I'm in the Melph pickin up Chuck
Got your bitch riding everything but the bus
Bloods led by Miss Sadie Glutz gloves
Harrassing me, asking me 'where did she come from?'
Malignant mist steadily pumps the funk
Well, it's A.B., the baby of the month
When we land in your city, they feed us lunch
All the real niggas sayin 'Chuuch!'
