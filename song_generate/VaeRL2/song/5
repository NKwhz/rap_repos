They say you can't be gangsta if you're not in black
Step in my way nigga, I wouldn't wanna be ya
I be getting money, I pull off in the Jag
Call it trap funk 'cause we having gas backs, and we put the fork in the trap
Respect the fact pack a Mac if your pocket's flat
Puff puff puff pass with your hoggin ass
Love God but prayed so much I should have bought kneepads
You ran into the wrong niggaz
Can you feel it, it's your boy Bang
It's gonna be sad, holding into wanna be fads
'Yeah Twiz is dope and you sound really good on this track'
Hip-hop ain't kill your boy and
Your read easy live with your corny stash
We'll cock these raps and put some AC units in your stocking caps
To make sure you're his man
Shattered his dome, reached in the pocket, took the boy's bank
