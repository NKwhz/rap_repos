Disrespect that Tech trick get done.
Suede Air Stabs, shaved hair cut
Go to the pen and get with them punks
she a'int a Nicki fan then the bitch def dumb
And all them cats that's talkin' 'bout trappin' and sellin' them drugs
Pay no mind to the motherfucking lies that they tell us
grab the Black Book and sley 'em up
es gibt bei dir f?r einen ohne Cash kein Genuss
So when they come to evict you can make them run
And when we left the club
You gettin' cash and taken care of
Always finding shit but can't find a man to date them, huh
Crank you up, me and my brother we came to get CRUNK
And as far as accessories, they second to none
People feel deep when the weekend comes
Sleepy bacon egg McMuff-
