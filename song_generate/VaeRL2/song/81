Another ocean another ocean
Caught a case and his whole damn brother told
I don't trust that ho, fuck that ho, why he go and love her fo'
No catching up he's in a whole another zone
I shatter and splatter bodies that blows and bust nerds, OPEN!
but when im not with her man I dicking down another ho
And they never took another soul
Rapid like a thunderbolt
It made me to push a bently witness me drive by and fuck parole
When he see that ass rise like a buttered roll
And strike the side and upper post
you don't gotta go I'll find another hoe
I heard styles that others stole
I'm on the road, another night, another show
Yo, hot damn, Doc a Jam like a Summer Show
Like a touch of a rose
