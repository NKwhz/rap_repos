In love with rap so I made the mistake and married it
The things get the ejected and flying
They were always on the A.L.-I-will-take-a-hike tip
It's a lot of niggas out sayin they act like this
But that's straight, I'm just tellin' 'em the way that I live
Real gangsta shit! This ain't plastic spit
dirty ass street nigga, stained an the scarin shit,
Asking Destiny's Child if they'd have my children
It's mad trife I seen enditments trap my team
I even lost Bam in it, wait a damn minute
Uh, I need 11's in these, matter of fact while you at it, bring 'em in a size 6
Yea thanks my nigga, yea thanks my nigga
So place your bets 'cause them garbage kids ain't passin' me
And I'll be spittin' this way past 60
Always bitchin', cryin', yellin', and tryin'
In my blood in my veins it be the way that I be
