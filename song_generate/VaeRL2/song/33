So all you niggas fuck you
You fucked up the thing between us two
The hood day comin' up, shit I'm gonna need some shoes
I'm runnin with the Legion of Doom
Like bailing out crooked companies will lead one through
unacceptable, unbelievably uncouth
Fire hydrant on a fiend cleanin' up the coupe
Rhymin' in the lunch room
Jumping on stage with a mic trying to mean mug fools
Bitch my flow wild like it's been cut loose
Whassup kids?  The Ab is speaking from the moon
I don't believe you and maybe this time I'll be the one to
My nigga Will still here, man I wish it was truth
Do I read books?  Naah, I read instructions too
I was bangin on tables, rhymin in the lunchroom
Y'all niggas is sweet, easily become food
