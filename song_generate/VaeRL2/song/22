It takes more than a few weeks to learn
It's anything that's kind of shocking or amusing, word
It's been more than a few years
Lost a good friend, had to pour a few beers
The seeds of weeds and crops is much more than you figure
Who's the boss get tossed have you seen her
Save that  for your bathroom mirror
14 karat gold bathroom fixtures
On the way to the Mary, ya'll bout to act a fool with er
The world ends with a bang as you whimper
We deep in love, like can't you see world?
So as a man here's a couple things I ask you hear
In the kitchen with the envy then hop Lamborghini, that's a two seater
You're skeptical at first, but I'm glad that you cheer
You can't fool me girl
Hoppin' out of that two seater, doot doot, that's a new Beamer
