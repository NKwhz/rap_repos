Indeed shots an ?hebock? on weed to escalate ya
Cause he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin hand
Gyal mi love yo breast and, great ass
Oh yeah you down to move a pound, where ya weight at
Don't let 'em rap they whack
Little old peck, crevas-faced faggot
I spotted this object, a stray cat
And see God's presence, a present, gift wrapped
Talk that slang, gon' head and let it bang
And if we want it then the jacka take that
Yo, there better be enough for me to get that maid back
I let the champagne splash
I'll pull out my pen and spray cats
If they hustle, I wish they'd get back to sellin crack
I gotta spank em, shank em with the thang
To smash Iran and then snatch they land?
