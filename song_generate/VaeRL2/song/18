Raisin' my fingers to critics raisin' my head to the sky
Unless you're twisted, demented and depressed and shit
From the start to the finish, diminish them in my spare time
Mommy in the grave, daddy gettin' high
On the block white is selling like Eminem
Hide your wives, trying to get inside them thighs
Heavy problems genocide desensitized environments
So imma continue to strike and stay alone and maintain my self-pride
When she said she want my kinds and help me make my next dime
They pay the price to wear ice
Uh, you know I got the shine when it's time to get mine
In every other month I make like 10 at least
Dem si mi tek hi but dem cyaa ask mi weh mi get hi
I see that hate in they eyes, my playas makin them blind
Blessed pon di mic a respect maximum
Breakin them off on sight, stoppin lives like red lights
