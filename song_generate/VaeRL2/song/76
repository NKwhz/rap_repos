Make peace with your momma the consequence is dire
That's what you get for not listenin' FIRE!!
i'm like hip hop yall niggas is rap singers
Or convicts in ricers
I'm feelin' like I'm walkin in fire
Tryin' to squabb with the clip and the trigger
Man this chick got it, she a thinger
Plies real, you're preachin to the choir
After you learn how to play the field, rocking the act vigor
I wake up, 3 in the morning, I'm tired
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
Analyze everybody in my church
Even though I pray to God I'm still a sinner
On the block they calling me the fireman
The dealer ain't problem, nigga it's the supplier
And that Ciroc mixed with that beer
