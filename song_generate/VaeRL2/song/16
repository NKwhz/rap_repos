And that's the reason that I'm steady switchin my address
And I ain't even in my bag yet
If you wanna release baby Ill fight that there
I just want to puff reefa and make it seem like aretha
Love my medical hating niggas disguised as friends
Bred to be ballin since a baby kickin, I had to smell
seekin me, rippin these niggaz, with a sentence
you ridin, I'm ridin-time to grab the weapons
Herbo, Lil Bibby, we at it again
Tryin' to mack to this bitch with this dyke ass friend
But now, see I see behind that sketch
Daddy Rich bringin em back, stingin em like a henchman
Cause I be in the flyest affairs
I'ma ride this bitch like a Benz
Treat bitch niggas like a stepson
Learn the difference between life and death
