you get down but you ain't a gold digger
Yeah I'm a dope dealer
Any man first curse dem lip a go reverse
We real killers, eight pack gold grillers
Wit no Hennessey and no reefer
What my nigga  I ain't tryin to be one of ya fake ass goldigger
Even though I can see clear that Reign has no fear
Pulling up in a Benz with a ho with her
Niks is sick, dimes could eat away at yo liver
You couldn't stand to take a close picture
Hoes give up ass while these ho niggaz hold triggers
Cruisin Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
Let me throw him a coat to winter
Show me that stranger and I'll show you homies that know me for a
he swore on the turf, put his ass hole in the dirt
Your lil ass go figure
