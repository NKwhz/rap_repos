Here we go I'm in Bal Harbor
Competition's in fear, I could make a star burst
Who better fit the bill? I myself, I'm a starter
I ain't Clarence Carter
This mic is bein held in the hands of an archer
but the game mattered less when I became a father
I'm no joke, this ain't Hanna Barbera
Leaving you torn apart wit all tha pain and tha hurt
Peep this 5'6'' nigga with more game than Starter
I hope my words make ya start to churn
Same black parker
But you aks one me and we can start to flirt
Examine the master, slick, damage and armour
But somehow when I ran to the Father to give my hand to the Father
That club got a girl but I'm actin like a bachlor
I'm tippin down on them craigers, I'm skatin like Darren Harper
