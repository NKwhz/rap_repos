# Dope-Lyrics Generation

[TOC]

## Datasets and Settings
[Malmi et al. 2016](https://github.com/ekQ/dopelearning) generated $100$ verses using $100$ random rap lines. These verses were produced using LineLength, EndRhyme, EndRhyme-1, BOW, BOW5, and **NN5**. We use the same $100$ first rap lines, and generate $100$ verses. The following lines are from the corpus created in  the NextLine prediction task.
