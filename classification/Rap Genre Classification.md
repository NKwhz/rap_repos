# Rap Genre Classification

[TOC]

- **Problem Definition.** Given a set of $n$ rap songs $S=\left\{S_1,S_2,...,S_n\right\}$, and a set of $m$ genre labels $\mathcal{G}=\left\{g_1,g_2,...,g_m\right\}$, the aim is to map a set of $k$ labels $\mathcal{L}=\left\{\ell_1,\ell_2,...,\ell_k\right\}(\mathcal{L}\subseteq \mathcal{G})$ with $S_{i(1\leq i\leq n)}$.
- **Dataset.** Suffering from copyright problems and the absence of researches on rap genre classification, we create a dataset including 10,167 songs and 9 genres. First, we divide rappers into 9 popular genres $\mathcal{G}=\left\{g_1,g_1,...,g_9\right\}$ according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Hip_hop_musicians_by_genre). The genre labels of a rap song $S_i$ are tagged by its artist set $A=\left\{a_{i,1},a_{i,2},...,a_{i, n}\right\}$($n$ is the number of the $i_{th}$ song's artists). $g_{j(1\leq j\leq 9)}$ is added into the $i_{th}$ song's label set only if $a_{i,k(1\leq k\leq n)} \in g_j$. Essentially Speaking, the rap genre classification task is a multi-label classification task.
- **Baseline Models.**
	- **RhymeAPP** ([Hirjee and Brown 2010a](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rhymeanalyzer)). A lyrical analysis tool can calculate 24 statistical features of a rap song.
	- **Rhyme2vec.** It includes mere rhyming representations.
	- **Doc2vec.** It includes mere semantic representations.
	- **HAN-L** ([Tsaptsinos 2017](https://github.com/alexTsaptsinos/lyricsHAN)). A state-of-the-art approach,  running at the line level, can generate song vectors using  hierarchical attention network.
- **Experiment Setting.** For the semantic representation $\bm s$, we just use the whole song as the input of the semantic section in Section \ref{im}. \par
% For rhyming features, we take 3 steps. First, we regard a whole rap song as a rhyming pair and compute its rhyming vector $\bm {l_0}$. In this step, we obtain the ``AAA'' vector of a song. Second, we extract all the odd lines and computing their rhyming vector $\bm {l_{odd}}$. At the same time, we conduct the same procedure on the even lines and obtain $\bm {l_{even}}$. We obtain the ``ABAB'' vector by adding $\bm {l_{odd}}$ and $\bm {l_{even}}$. Finally, we feed $\bm {l_0}$ and $\bm {l_1}$ into the proposed rhythm embedding model Pho2vec, and obtain the rhyming representation of a rap song $\bm {r}$.\par
% The final song vector $\bm \mu$ is generated by feeding $\bm s$ and $\bm r$ into the union-training module.
% We use all methods to produce a 9 dimensional variable $\bm y$ through a same sigmoid network. If $y_{j(1\leq j\le 9)}\le i$, we set $\hat y_{j(1\leq j\le 9)}=0$, otherwise,  $\hat y_{j(1\leq j\le 9)}=1$. $i$ is a stated parameter. $\bm {\hat y}=\left\lbrace \hat y_0,\hat y_1, ...,\hat y_9 \right\rbrace $ is the predicted label set.
% %every three lines as a unit and obtain a pho2vec representation\footnote{If the last unit contains only two lines, we just compute AAA vector of the unit; if the last unit contains only one line, it is abandoned.}, the final rhyming vector is the average value of all unit vectors of a song. About the ASVAE model, we take $\bm \mu$ as the integrated vector of a rap song.
% \item {\bf Evaluation \& Results.}  The results of the average micro-F1 are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:micro}, the results of the average macro-F1 are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:macro}.\par
% Overall, VaeRL$^2$ significantly outperforms other methods, especially when $i=0.2$. This indicates VaeRL$^2$ can be applied in various cases, and it has strong ability to capture prosodic information and semantic information in rap lyrics. Obviously, it is also easy to transplant VaeRL$^2$ into other rhyming text related field, e.g., poetry analysis.
